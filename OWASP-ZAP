OWASP - ZAP (Open Web Application Security Project - Zed Attack Proxy)
=====================================================================

- ZAP is a java based application
- You can run it using .exe file, jar, .sh  or .bat file


Override options while staring ZAP
----------------------------------

-config -  specified key-values pairs in config file
-daemon - run in backg
-host - specified host
-port - specifies port
-newsession -  start a new session . You can specify the session name
-session - You can refer to previous session


All activities reocred by ZAP are stored in a local database for a particular session. So you can always refer to previous session (last configuration option above)
and start from where you left.


- Download and install ZAP
- Open Browser and set the proxy : ---  localhost, port: 8080

- Add addon Foxyproxy basic for automating proxy in browser
- Add the new proxy with the addon and set it.
- Also set the same proxy port in ZAP too. By going to Tools -> Options 
- You also need to generate to SSL certificate using the ZAP tool. Tools -> Options -> SSL (something). Create and save the certificate
- Add it to the firefox. Prefernces -> Advances > certificates -> import the saved certifcate. Also select the checkox 


ZAP tool acts as a man in the middle attack.
1. Browser sends encrpted informaton. Say Hello as 110011
2. ZAP intercepts it and decrypts it. It again encrypts/modified the information  using its own certificate. 110011 -> hello -> 22002 (ZAP encryoted information)
3. ZAP send this information to the server.


Define the scope to be tested.
- You should not test any site which you do not have authority to test.
- Say your site has Youtube vidoes embedded, or has cdn urls or image from diffreent hosts. Then you should not pen tests these sites. Define the 
scope/context to just your sites.
